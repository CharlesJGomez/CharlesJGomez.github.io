    "A network is simply a set of relations between objects which could be people, organizations, nations, items found in a Google search, brain cells, or electrical transformers. A network contains a set of objects--called nodes--and relations between them, called edges or links. We live surrounded by social networks, but usually cannot see more than one step beyond the people we are directly connected to, if that. (It is like being stuck in a traffic jam surrounded by cars and trucks.) Social network theory is one of the few theories in social science that can be applied to a variety of levels of analysis from small groups and organizations to nations and international and global systems. \n",

    "# Creating and Plotting Directed, Weighted, and Multiplex Edges in Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've only discussed one type of edge. However, there are many different kinds of relationships that we can represent with an edge. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a friendship edge might represent a relationship shared between two people (although friendship can be surprisingly one-sided, especially in adolescent networks of frienships),\n",
    "- but it can also represent sending/receiving something (e.g., sending and receiving a text).\n",
    "- The edge can also carry a weight (e.g., how many times did you text someone and how many texts did you receive.), as we mentioned above.\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below highlights the different forms that edges in a network can take:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We've covered undirected and directed, so far.\n",
    "- The figure also includes an illustration of weighted edges (in other words, the \"intensity\" of the relationship or transaction can vary between nodes, like how people who send a lot of text messages would have a heavier weight to their edge as compared to people who texted one another infrequently).\n",
    "- And you can also see the related idea of multiplex edges, where multiple edges can represent the relationship between two nodes, with slight variations. For instance, imagine if we created a network where we not only measured how often people texted, but also how often they call one another, send messages on social media, etc. Each of these relationships are distinct edges in the network. These edges can either be undirected or directed, and they can also have weight. "
