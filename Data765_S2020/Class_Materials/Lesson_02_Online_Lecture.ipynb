    "### Why `python`?\n",
    "There are a number of reasons why python is a useful programming language for data science. Some of these are technical. Python happens to be:\n",
    "- fast\n",
    "- modular\n",
    "- object oriented\n",
    "- (relatively) easy to read\n",
    "\n",
    "But python also carries the added benefit of being extremely popular. This may seem like a crass reason for choosing a programming language, but in this case it is important. Much of python's functionality comes from extensions that are written by users, or what python calls libraries. And because python is so popular, it has a ton of libraries to choose from.\n",
    "\n",
    "So from a pragmatic point of view, python is useful for at least two more reasons:\n",
    "- lots of libraries\n",
    "- *gets the job done*\n",
    "\n",
    "One last note: choice of primary programming language should really depend on your preferred style of thinking and tools of choice (e.g., linear models? decision trees?). But you'll never know if it's right (or wrong) for you unless you give it a try!"

The idea here is that each time through the loop `i` will take the value of the next element in `1st_list`, while `j` will take the value of the next element in `2nd_list`. `zip()` is just a function for combining lists together into paired elements (or `tuples`). So if your first list contains the days of the week, and your second list contains the days of the month, `zip()` will create a list containing `[Sunday, 1], [Monday, 2], [Wednesday, 3]...` and so on.\n",
